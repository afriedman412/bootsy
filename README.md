# Predicting 70s & 80s Funk Album Movement On Billboard Charts
I really like funk and R&B from the 70's and 80's and I have spent a lot of my life digging through crates full of cheap records. That's really all the background there is for this deeply silly project.

I definitely don't think anything here beyond the basic concept would be useful for the modern music industry. Billboard metrics change with the times, and the 70s and 80s were very different. This is less an exercise in business strategy than a chance to crack myself up by having Luther Vandross and Evelyn "Champagne" King show up in my data.
